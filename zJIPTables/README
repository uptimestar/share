jIPtables - Java library for iptables
by Daniel Zozin <zdenial@gmx.com>

This library provides a communication interface to the iptables firewall, to linux netfilter logger and connection tracker.

The jIPtables rule management system allows to parse, generate and apply the iptables rules to the local linux machine.
The log tracker provides a java notification system for low level netfilter log events.
The connection tracker notifies for established connections and connection state changes.

INSTALLATION
The full implementation of jIPtables requires libnetfilter_log and libnetfilter_conntrack in order to be compiled.
You can download them at http://www.netfilter.org/

If you want to use the full implementation, after installing the required libraries go into the main directory and type:
ant build

If you want only to use the netfilter event logger type:
ant build-log

If you want only to use the netfilter connection tracker type:
ant build-conn

The ant script will generate the compiled library files.

USAGE
To use the library you must include the jar archive in your project and place the compiled library files in a system library directory or in the working directory.
The doc directory contains the library javadoc documentation.

In order to access to the firewall and netfilter functionalities the library needs the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.
You can set that capability by adding to /etc/security/capability.conf a line like:

cap_net_admin        YOUR-APP-USER

replacing YOUR-APP-USER with the username that runs the application.
